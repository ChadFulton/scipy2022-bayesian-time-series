# Bayesian Estimation and Forecasting of Time Series in Statsmodels

``Statsmodels``, a Python library for statistical and econometric analysis,
has traditionally focused on frequentist inference, including in its
models for time series data. This Poster illustrates the powerful features
for Bayesian inference of time series models that exist in ``statsmodels``, with
applications to model fitting, forecasting, time series decomposition,
data simulation, and impulse response functions.
